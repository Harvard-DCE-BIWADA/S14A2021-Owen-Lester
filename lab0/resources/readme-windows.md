## Installing & Using WSL on Windows

1. Instructions for activating WSL and running Ubuntu can be found here:
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL
    
2. After enabling WSL, reboot and install the default version of Ubuntu from the MS Store, then skip to the section entitled Running Ubuntu on WSL.
3. Once it has been launched, go ahead and type these two commands:  
    `sudo apt update`  
    `sudo apt upgrade -y`  
to update the packages to their current versions.

4. python3 should already be installed, but you will need to install an editor (or IDE), possibly anaconda and heroku from here. (See readme-linux_or_wsl.md for details)  
You should now be able to run all of the steps required for the lab without modifying any of the commands.
